Command Line Parser Library
Version 1.6.0.5 (Stable)
Latest Update: 01-nov-2009.

General Info:
This library allows command line arguments parsing.
This work were inspired by the GNU LIBC getopt()/getopt_long() functions
(check out: http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html).

Build:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[WIN/NET] This version of the code use some C# 3.0 features (still targeting .NET 2.0);
to successfully compile the project you need to modify the NAnt configuration file
(NAnt.exe.config). Seek the <frameworks> node and add (e.g. after net-2.0 definition)
the content of 'net-3.5_fx-node.nant-conf' located in '{libroot}/nant' folder.
[LINUX/MONO] When you compile with NAnt under Linux be sure to have a version of Mono
which supports C# 3.0 like 2.1 or higher (but I suggest you Mono 2.4).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use NAnt (http://nant.sourceforge.net/), you should copy (*1) your
  nunit.framework.dll
to the {libroot}/lib subdirectory (located in the root directory of the library).
Unit Tests are compatible from NUnit 2.2.0.
Change current directory to {libroot}/nant.
Production Release:
	nant build
Debug+Tests Release:
	nant tests
Mono users must use 
	nant {target}
If you still have problems try adding -t:net-3.5 (or -t:mono-3.5 under Linux) between
nant command and target string.
You will find binaries in {libroot}/nant/build.out; warning each run will overwrite
the previous.
	
Unit Tests:
To run unit tests you should copy (*1)
	{libroot}/lib/nunit.framework.dll
in the build output directory
(created from NUnit build script -> {libroot}/nant/default.build)
	{libroot}/nant/build.out.
	
*1) Under Linux/Mono you can use the nunit.framework.dll stored in the GAC,
using GAC Extraction Utility (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gac-get/);
